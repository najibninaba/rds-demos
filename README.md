# RDS Fundamentals Demo & Walkthrough

There are 5 parts to making this simple data project reproducible. Each part is committed as a separate branch and you can access the data project in the `fundamentals/simple` directory. Refer below for details:

1. `git checkout part01` for the beginning status of the data project.
2. `git checkout part02` is when we added some documentation on getting started and an environment file for loading up the dependencies.
3. `git checkout part03` is when we separate out the data location to a known (sub)directory, and note the difference between raw data and derived data. We also updated the Jupyter Notebook to cater to this new change.
4. `git checkout part04` is when we create a simple script to re-download the raw data file from the source. We also added some documentation to the data/raw and data/derived directories for some clarity.
5. `git checkout part05` is when we initiated some beginning automation work by creating Make targets as well as catered for the different platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OSX) that our collaborators may be using.
